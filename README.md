# AVSB Cloud system

**AVSB** is the _Anti Virus Sound Bubble_, a system to measure distances between 2 persons (holding 2 AVSB devices) using ultrasound signals.

The **AVSB Cloud** component is the central database and cryptographic key authority of the AVSB system.

The **AVSB System** consists of these components:

- **AVSB Device** -- a small, light and wearable personal device that autonomously measures the distance to other devices
- **AVSB App** -- an App for Apple/iOS and Andriod that can connect to the device to set it up and download data
- **AVSB Cloud** -- a scalable cloud-based (AWS and Azure) application for management of AVSB accounts, cryptographic keys and central database

This repo will soon contain the design documents and source code and all you need to build this system on your own.
